Chord DHT API
=================

The Chord DHT API provides a set of classes and functions to interact with the Chord Distributed Hash Table (DHT). It allows users to perform operations such as joining the network, storing and retrieving data, and managing node dynamics.
In this folder, it is specifically modified for the SuperDARN project, to allow for the storage of radar data in a distributed manner. The API is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it easy to integrate with existing applications.

This is accessible from every node, allowing for seamless communication and data sharing across the network.

Hopefully, this means several researchers who have this on their work station, might be able to pool compute, without worries if one machine leaves.
